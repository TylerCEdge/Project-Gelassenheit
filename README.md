# Project-Gelassenheit

![](./src/Gelassenheit.jpeg)

Heres the purpose...

Gelassenheit is German for serenity. I just want a space away from the noise.

One of the most detrimental things to the learning process involved in development for me has been based on some advice I see used heavily.

That advice is to make something a business could use.

Learning is supposed to be fun.

I just want a place where there are no rules.

A place where things don't have to be anything but what you make them.

I want a place to let my creativity run free and a place where its ok to render something just for the sake of rendering it.

Project Gelassenheit is an evolving projection of myself.

This is where I get to rock my unique personality. This is where 2 + 2 = 5. I'm in charge here and I'm going to have fun with it.

This is where I divide by 0.

Welcome to Project Gelassenheit!!!
